# School Catalogue

This JavaScript project was a part of the Codecademy Front-End Engineer course that I am currently taking. Similarly to my previous JS project, 'Library Catalogue,' in this project, I was tasked with creating a parent class with multiple child classes that are supposed to create a sort of catalogue of various schools to choose from. 

## Skills learned

- JS classes
- Inheritance
- Getters and setters
